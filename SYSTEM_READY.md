# 🎉 System Ready - Complete Claude Multi-Provider Setup

## ✅ What's Working

### **🎛️ Claude Manager (Main Control)**
```bash
./claude-manager.sh status      # Check current setup
./claude-manager.sh official    # Use paid Claude Pro
./claude-manager.sh free        # Use free APIs
./claude-manager.sh one-balance # Use production proxy
./claude-manager.sh backup      # Backup settings
./claude-manager.sh chat        # Start chat with current setup
```

### **🆓 Direct API Chat (Recommended for Free Usage)**
```bash
./direct-api-chat.sh
# - Direct Gemini API access (working)
# - Direct Qwen API access (working)
# - No proxy complications
# - Type 'status' to check providers
```

### **⚖️ One-Balance System (Production-Grade)**
```bash
# Web UI: https://one-balance.bluehawana.workers.dev
# Add API keys through web interface first
./claude-manager.sh one-balance
./claude-manager.sh chat
```

### **🔧 Custom Worker Proxy**
```bash
# URL: https://claude-worker-proxy.bluehawana.workers.dev
# Supports: Gemini, Qwen, AnyRouter (when not blocked)
./hybrid-chat.sh  # Smart fallback between providers
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide
